# floorplan-qa

Utilities for downloading and working with the
[FloorplanQA layouts dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/OldDelorean/FloorplanQA-Layouts).

## Download the dataset

From this directory, run:

```shell
uv run download-floorplan-qa
```

The files are downloaded to `datasets/FloorplanQA-Layouts/`. This directory is
ignored by Git.

The dataset is public, so authentication is normally unnecessary. If Hugging
Face requests authentication, set the `HF_TOKEN` environment variable or run
`hf auth login` before running the download command.

## Check out the question-generation tooling

To materialize the upstream FloorplanQA code without creating a nested Git
repository, run:

```shell
uv run checkout-fpqa-tooling
```

The command downloads a GitHub source archive into `fpqa-tooling/`. Source
archives do not contain `.git` metadata, and the destination is ignored by the
main repository. Use `--revision <branch-tag-or-commit>` to select something
other than `main`.

## Generate training questions

Generate all eight deterministic QA tasks for each requested layout. Layouts
are drawn by a seeded uniform shuffle over the complete released corpus; the
generator does not force room-source or answer-class balance:

```shell
./scripts/generate_questions.sh 20 1
```

This selects 20 layouts and writes 160 records to
`datasets/train-qa/questions.jsonl`, replacing that file on each run. It also
writes `generation-report.json` with complete-layout yield and observed source
counts. If the seed is omitted, it defaults to `0`.

Each record includes task parameters, a typed reference answer, fixed-template
prompt messages, input-validation results, solver settings, convergence data,
and version provenance. The `paper-v2` implementation uses continuous
first-collision repositioning, configuration-space placement with exact
witnesses or certified negatives, deterministic global Max Box search, and
0.15 m-clearance grid A* for shortest paths. Visibility intentionally uses
actual polygon intersections rather than paper-style bounding boxes.

## Evaluate generation quality

Generate the same sample twice, then compare it while revalidating every
reference answer and geometry witness:

```shell
./scripts/generate_questions.sh 20 7
cp datasets/train-qa/questions.jsonl /tmp/questions-first.jsonl
./scripts/generate_questions.sh 20 7
./scripts/evaluate_generation.sh \
  datasets/train-qa/questions.jsonl \
  /tmp/questions-first.jsonl
```

The hard gates are documented in
[`question-gen.md`](question-gen.md#quality-metrics-and-validation).
The evaluator also reports the unforced room-source and Placement-answer
distributions as advisory measurements.

## Evaluate local Qwen 3.5 4B models

Both evaluators accept a QA JSONL path, remove reference/assistant messages from
each record, run one example at a time, print a per-example verdict, and finish
with an aggregate score. Scoring follows the paper: 2% relative error for
scalar tasks, 5% for free space, exact Boolean Placement, set-equality
Visibility, and collision-free shortest paths within 0.6 m discrete Frechet
distance of the reference.

With Ollama running and `qwen3.5:4b` available:

```shell
./scripts/evaluate_ollama.sh datasets/train-qa/questions.jsonl
```

For a reproducible batch evaluation, generate an 80-layout pool and uniformly
sample 150 questions with a seed (default `0`):

```shell
caffeinate -dimsu ./scripts/evaluate_ollama_random.sh 0
```

The batch uses `qwen3.5:4b` with temperature zero, thinking disabled, and a
768-token output budget per question. It checkpoints a structured JSON report
after every response at `datasets/evaluations/qwen3.5-4b-seed-<seed>.json`, so a
partial run remains inspectable. Pass a second argument to choose another JSON
path. `MODEL`, `SAMPLE_SIZE`, `POOL_LAYOUTS`, and `MAX_TOKENS` environment
variables are available for controlled smoke tests or alternate runs; the
defaults perform the requested 150-question evaluation.

On Apple silicon, run the Hugging Face-hosted MLX-LM 4-bit conversion with:

```shell
./scripts/evaluate_huggingface.sh datasets/train-qa/questions.jsonl
```

Pass `--thinking` to either command to enable Qwen's thinking mode. Use
`--model` or `--max-tokens` after the JSONL path to override the defaults.
